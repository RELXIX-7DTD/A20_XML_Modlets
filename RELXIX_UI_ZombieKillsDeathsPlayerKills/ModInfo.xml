		<Description value="Adds Zombie Kills and Deaths counters to the HUD with icons that change from Black to White as counts rise.  Due to removal of PlayerStatsWindow controller to get this working had to resort to ChracterFrameWindow controller.  This means it starts disabled and you have to click the little zombie head next to the toolbar every time you play to get it to display." />
