		<Description value="With an already restricted FOV the added restriction on the NV Goggles just felt too much.  By combining 2 filter sets I was able to get a faded feel for nightvision without the goggle blockage but retain a bit of color.  I felt Bright effect as an alternative to the NightVision effect alone made it too much like daytime so added the VibrantDeSat to dull the colors some." />
